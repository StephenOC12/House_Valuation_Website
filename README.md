# House_Valuation_Website
 - Built a website in Python through Flask where high volumes of data were selected from a table using SQL
 - Used linear regression to make valuations of house prices based on a variety of factors such as the number of
bedrooms and bathrooms and used Lasso regression to calculate which of these variables had the most significant
impact on the value
 - The website allowed users to enter their houseâ€™s information alongside the valuation which would be stored in a
3NF database so that they could return to this information later
